My solutions to some of the Project Euler questions. I'm new to the inner workings of Ruby and plan to go back from time to time to improve the aesthetics/efficiency of this code. 

Also, upon occasion, I've borrowed others' ideas or some lines of code, both because they've come up with good implementations of basic mathematical ideas I need, and because I think I learn best from the work of better coders.
